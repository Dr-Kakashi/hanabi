# About

## Standard Scoring
* Game points = Total Max Score + Bonus Points
* Bonus Points = 0.1 * (# of cards left in the deck + # of clues left)
  * Example:
You score 25 points with 3 cards remaining in deck and have 2 clues.
Total Max Score = 25
Bonus Points = 3 + 2 = 5
Game Points = 25 + 5 = 30
* A bombed deck (3 strikes) will only score the points they’ve received up to that point
  * Example
You score 10 points, but received a 3rd strike to end the game.  Game Points will be 10
Thus, you are more inclined to complete a game as you will receive bonus points for doing so.
