# Number Mute Conventions

* These conventions are optimal for a 2-player game.
* If you want to try these conventions in a 3-player game, see the [modification](#modification) below.
* For a 4 or more player game, it is proved that hat-guessing is better than these number mute conventions.

## General Conventions

### Turn 1 Saves
* In turn 1, any clue touching the chop is a _Save Clue_ on the chop card.
* Notes: No _Play Clues_ in turn 1.

### Turn 1 Stalls & Chop Moves
* In turn 1, any clue not touching the chop is just a _Stall Clue_.
* However, it is so bad to burn a 0-for-1 clue in turn 1. Thus, players are agreed to chop move the clued card(s) and keep them for the rest of the game.
* Notes: No _Play Clues_ in turn 1.

### Positional Clues
* Any clue is treated as _a positional clue_. See the [rules](#number-mute-positional-clue-rules) below.

### 8 Clue Stalls
* If the next player has no clued cards, then it is treated as _Turn 1 Stalls_. (**Do not** chop move the clued card(s).)
* If the next player has clued card(s) with only one color, then you should clue the same color as a Stall Clue; otherwise, it is treated as a Play Clue.
* If the next player has clued cards with two or more colors, then you should give the "rightmost" color clue as a Stall Clue; otherwise, it is treated as a Play Clue.
* For example: 
  * In Number Mute (5 Suits) game, Bob has unknown red and green cards in hand.
  * Alice is in 8 clues situation, if she clues green to Bob, then it is just a _Stall Clue_.
  * However, if she gives a clue with any other color, then it is treated as a _Play Clue_.

### About Saves
* Use _Scream Discard_, _The Scream Blind-Play_, or _The Skipped Discard Chop Move_ to save cards on chop.
* In some specific situations, you can give a teal clue as a _Chop Move_.

### About Discards
* _Good Touch Principle_ does not apply to Number Mutes, which means you should always discard the right-most card unless it was chop moved.

## Advanced Strategies

### Focus Slides
* If the player knows the target of the positional clue is not playable from context, then the target slides over and targets the slot one position to the right.
* For example:
  * Alice discards.
  * And Bob clues something to Alice.
  * Then Alice gives a red clue to Bob touching a card on slot 1 (telling him to play "slot 1").
  * If that red card was playable, Alice would definitely give a red clue to Bob last turn. This implies the playable card is on slot 2 (slide-over) instead of slot 1.
  * Bob blind-plays slot 2.

### Stacked Play Clues
* If the same color is clued again before you play the target that was gotten last turn, it means there is another playable card "stacked" behind the gotten card.
* For example:
  * Alice gives a red to Bob (telling him to play slot 1).
  * Bob clues something to Alice.
  * Alice gives a red clue again, which means Bob has another playable card on slot 2 (stacked behind the playable card on slot 1).

## Modification

* Number Mute Convention Modification for 3 or more player games.

### General Principles
* This is a _Hard Variant_, which means no _DDA_, no _5 Stall_ (of course, lol), and _Loaded Play Clue_ is turned on, etc.
* _Good Touch Principle_ does not apply to this variant. You should always discard your rightmost card unless it's got cm'ed or saved.
* No _Ejections_, _Discharges_, and any move required blind-playing two or more cards.

### Turn 1 Stalls
* Any clue given to the **next** player is either a Save Clue (touching the chop) or a Stall Clue (touching the other cards) in turn 1.
* However, if the next player who receives a Stall Clue sees another _Play Clue_ available to give, then the "Stall Clue" should be interpreted as a _Play Clue_. (Same logic as a _5 Pull_.)
* Any other clue on the other players is always a _Play Clue_.

### The Chosen One Principle
* While giving a positional clue, if there are two or more player have the same specific color in hand. You should always give that color clue to the player who needs to blind-play.
* For example, in a 3 player game:
  * Both Bob and Cathy have a green card(s) in hand. And both of them have a playable card on slot 3.
  * Alice gives a green clue to Bob. (Telling someone to play slot 3)
  * Bob sees Cathy has a playable card on slot 3. However, from _The Chosen One Principle_, Bob knows that the positional clue is on him.
  * Bob blind-plays slot 3.

### About Stall Clues
* You must give a clue to the next player to perform a _Stall Clue_; or it is always treated as a _Play Clue_ (if you give a clue to other players).

### About Save Clues
* Any clue touching the _Chop_ on the **next** player is treated as a _Save Clue_.
* You are only allowed to give a _Save Clue_ when you are on the _Save Seat_ (the person directly before the player who receives a _Save Clue_).
* Notes: To save two critical cards in a row, use _Misplay Chop Move_.
