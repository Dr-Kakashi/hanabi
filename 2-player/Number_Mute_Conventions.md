# Number Mute Conventions

* These conventions are optimal for a 2-player game.
* If you want to try these conventions in a 3-player game, see the modification below.
* For a 4 or more player game, it is proved that hat-guessing is better than these number mute conventions.

## General Conventions

### Turn 1 Saves
* In turn 1, any clue touching the chop is a _Save Clue_ on the chop card.
* Notes: No _Play Clues_ in turn 1.

### Turn 1 Stalls & Chop Moves
* In turn 1, any clue not touching the chop is just a _Stall Clue_.
* However, it is so bad to burn a 0-for-1 clue in turn 1. Thus, players are agreed to chop move the clued card(s) and keep them for the rest of the game.
* Notes: No _Play Clues_ in turn 1.

### Positional Clues
* Any clue is treated as _a positional clue_. See the [rules](#number-mute-positional-clue-rules) below.

### 8 Clue Stalls
* If the next player has no clued cards, then it is treated as _Turn 1 Stalls_. (**Do not** chop move the clued card(s).)
* If the next player has clued card(s) with only one color, then you should clue the same color as a Stall Clue; otherwise, it is treated as a Play Clue.
* If the next player has clued cards with two or more colors, then you should give the "rightmost" color clue as a Stall Clue; otherwise, it is treated as a Play Clue.
* For example: 
  * In Number Mute (5 Suits) game, Bob has unknown red and green cards in hand.
  * Alice is in 8 clues situation, if she clues green to Bob, then it is just a _Stall Clue_.
  * However, if she gives a clue with any other color, then it is treated as a _Play Clue_.

### About Saves
* Use _Scream Discard_, _The Scream Blind-Play_, or _The Skipped Discard Chop Move_ to save cards on chop.
* In some specific situations, you can give a teal clue as a _Chop Move_.

### About Discards
* _Good Touch Principle_ does not apply to Number Mutes, which means you should always discard the right-most card unless it was chop moved.

## Advanced Strategies

### Focus Slides
* If the player knows the target of the positional clue is not playable from context, then the target slides over and targets the slot one position to the right.
* For example:
  * Alice discards.
  * And Bob clues something to Alice.
  * Then Alice gives a red clue to Bob touching a card on slot 1 (telling him to play "slot 1").
  * If that red card was playable, Alice would definitely give a red clue to Bob last turn. This implies the playable card is on slot 2 (slide-over) instead of slot 1.
  * Bob blind-plays slot 2.

### Stacked Play Clues
* If the same color is clued again before you play the target that was gotten last turn, it means there is another playable card "stacked" behind the gotten card.
* For example:
  * Alice gives a red to Bob (telling him to play slot 1).
  * Bob clues something to Alice.
  * Alice gives a red clue again, which means Bob has another playable card on slot 2 (stacked behind the playable card on slot 1).
