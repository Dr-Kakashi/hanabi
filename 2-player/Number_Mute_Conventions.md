# Number Mute Conventions

* These conventions are optimal for a 2-player game.
* If you want to try these conventions in a 3-player game, see the modification below.
* For a 4 or more player game, it is proved that hat-guessing is better than these number mute conventions.

## General Conventions

### Turn 1 Saves
* In turn 1, any clue touching the chop is a _Save Clue_ on the chop card.
* Notes: No _Play Clue_ in turn 1.

### Turn 1 Stalls & Chop Moves
* In turn 1, any clue not touching the chop is just a _Stall Clue_.
* However, it is so bad to burn a 0-for-1 clue in turn 1. Thus, players are agreed to chop move the clued card(s) and keep them for the rest of the game.
* Notes: No _Play Clue_ in turn 1.

### Positional Clues
* Any clue is treated as a positional clue. See the rules below.

### 8 Clue Stalls
* If the next player has no clued cards, then it is treated as _Turn 1 Stalls_. (Do not chop move the clued card.)
* If the next player has clued cards with only one color, then you should clue the same color as a Stall Clue; otherwise, it is treated as a Play Clue.
* If the next player has clued cards with two or more colors, then you should give the "rightmost" color clue as a Stall Clue; otherwise, it is treated as a Play Clue.
* For example: in 5 suits, Bob has unknown red and green cards in hand. Alice is in 8 clues situation, if she clues red to Bob, it is just a stall clue; however, if she gives a clue with other color, then it is treated as a play clue.

### About Saves
* In 2-player, use _Scream Discard_, _The Scream Blind-Play_, or _The Skipped Discard Chop Move_ to save cards on chop.
* Or give a teal clue in some specific situations.

### About Discards
* Good Touch Principle does not applly to Number Mutes, which means you should always discard right-most card unless it was chop moved.

## Advanced Strategies

### Focus Slides
* If the player knows the target of the positional clue is not playable from context, then the target slides over and targets the slot one position to the right.
* For example: Alice discards. Bob clues something to Alice. Then Alice clues Bobs "blue" touching a card on slot 1 (telling him to play "slot 1"). If that blue card was playable, Alice would just clue Bob last turn, which means he has a playable card on slot 2 instead of slot 1. Bob blind-plays slot 2.

### Stacked Play Clues
* If the same color is clued again before you play the target that was gotten last turn, it means there is another playable card "stacked" behind the gotten card.
* For example: Alice clues blue to Bob (means play slot 1). Bob clues something to Alice. Alice clues Bobs "blue" again, which means Bob has another playable card on slot 2.
