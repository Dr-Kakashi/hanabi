# Scores Hunting 2-Player Conventions

<br/>

## Introduction
* This is the document for scores hunting in 2-player games.
* The goal of these conventions is to get the perfect scores in non-classic variants with minimum attempts. Thus, they are designed to be quite aggressive.
* Most of the conventions follow the [2-Player Conventions](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/misc/2-Player.md) but have a little bit changed.

## General Conventions

### Conventions which are turned on
* 5's Chop Move
* 5 Pull
  * Note that the players are allowed to do a 5 Pull at the start of the *Mid-Game*.

### Conventions which are turned off
* One-Away Saves
* Second Turn Stalls
* 5's Double Chop Move
* Double Discard Save Stalls
* Scream Blind-Play (Blind-Playing Chop)
  * Scream Blind-Play is always double *Chop Move*.
  * If you want to *Chop Move* only one card while in no clues, use ***Skipped Discard Chop Move***.
* Double Skipped Discard Chop Move
  * It is treated as a *Positional Clue*.

### Crazy 3/4 Fake Saves
* If there are a 3 or 4 in the trash pile, and if the players don't know they have the other copy of that card (even it is in their hand), they are allowed to "fake save" a random 3 or 4 on chop. And the player who receives the clue shouldn't play into the finesse or bluff.
* Do not perform this move on a two-away 3 or 4. (Unless you think it is valuable.)

<br/>

## Variant-Specific Conventions

### Crazy Pink Bluff/Pull
* The players are allowed to use any pink card to do a *3 Bluff*, *4 Doulbe Bluff*, or *5 Pull*.
* *Pink Promise* doesn't apply to this move.

### Crazy Pink 5's Chop Move
* In some emergancy situation, the players are allowed to break the *Pink Promise* to do a *5's Chop Move* by touching a one-away-from-chop pink card with a 5 clue.
* You can only do this with a `pink 2` or a `critical pink card`.
