# Scores Hunting 2-Player Conventions

<br/>

## Introduction
* This is the document for scores hunting in 2-player games.
* The goal of these conventions is to get the perfect scores in non-classic variants with minimum attempts. Thus, they are designed to be quite aggressive.
* Most of the conventions follow the [2-Player Conventions](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/misc/2-Player.md) but have a little bit changed.

## General Conventions

### Conventions which are turned on
* 5's Chop Move
* 5 Pull
  * Note that the players are allowed to do a 5 Pull at the start of the *Mid-Game*.

### Conventions which are turned off
* One-Away Saves
* Second Turn Stalls
* 5's Double Chop Move
* Double Discard Save Stalls
* Scream Blind-Play (Blind-Playing Chop)
  * Scream Blind-Play is always double *Chop Move*.
  * If you want to *Chop Move* only one card while in no clues, use ***Skipped Discard Chop Move***.
* Double Skipped Discard Chop Move
  * It is treated as a *Positional Clue*.

### 4 Single Bluff
* The players are allowed to perform a *4 Single Bluff* by touching a two-away 4 with a rank clue, if the 4 looks like a one-away card, and this move only gets one blind-card.
* The 4 that was used as a *4 Single Bluff* is not promised to be one-away. And the player who receives the clue should mark nothing on their card.

### Crazy 3/4 Fake Saves
* If there are a 3 or 4 in the trash pile, and if the players don't know they have the other copy of that card (even it is in their hand), they are allowed to "fake save" a random 3 or 4 on chop. And the player who receives the clue shouldn't play into the finesse or bluff.
* Do not perform this move on a two-away 3 or 4. (Unless you think it is valuable.)

### Bold Saves
* If the player receives a *Play Clue* and they don't exactly know the identity of their card, and they see their teammate has a possible "matching" card on their chop (might not be true). Even though there are multiple possibilities for the card, in this situation if they know their teammate won't misplay or play into a *Finesse* or a *Bluff* from context, they can "protect" that card on chop by giving a clue directly.
* For example, in a 4 suits game:
  * Red 1 and blue 1 are played on the stacks.
  * Alice discarded last turn while Bob has a blue 3 on chop.
  * Bob gives a 2 clue touching a red 2 on Alice's slot 1.
  * Alice knows that the 2 could be either a red 2 or blue 2. If it is a blue 2 and Bob might discard the blue 3 if he has nothing to do. Alice gives a blue clue touching the blue 3 on Bob's chop.
  * Bob sees the only playable blue card is blue 2. However, if it is a blue 2, Alice will not disard last turn. He knows that Alice doesn't know the identity of her 2, if she has a blue 2, it is fair enough to protect the blue 3 on chop.
  * Bob marks his blue card as a 3 and discards

## Variant-Specific Conventions

### Crazy Pink Bluff/Pull
* This convention only applies to variants with a pink suit.
* The players are allowed to use any pink card to do a *3 Bluff*, *4 Doulbe Bluff*, or *5 Pull*.
* *Pink Promise* doesn't apply to this move.

### Crazy Pink 5's Chop Move
* This convention only applies to variants with a pink suit.
* In some emergancy situation, the players are allowed to break the *Pink Promise* to do a *5's Chop Move* by touching a one-away-from-chop pink card with a 5 clue.
* You can only do this with a `pink 2` or a `critical pink card`.
