# Scores Hunting 2-Player Conventions

<br/>

## Introduction
* This is the document for scores hunting in 2-player games.
* The goal of these conventions is to get the perfect scores in non-classic variants with minimum attempts. Thus, they are designed to be quite aggressive.
* Most of the conventions follow the [2-Player Conventions](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/misc/2-Player.md) but have a little bit changed.
