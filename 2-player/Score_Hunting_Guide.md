# Score Hunting Guide (2-Player)

* This is the guide for score hunting in 2-player games created by [IAMJEFF](https://github.com/iamwhoiamhahaha) in 2020..
* The goal of this document is to get the maximum score in any variant with the most efficient/minimum amount of attempts. Thus, they are designed to be quite aggressive.
* If you're looking for conservative way to play a 2-player game, please read [2-Player Conventions for the Hyphen-ated Framework](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/misc/2-Player.md).

## Introduction

* Hello!  This document is for those players who want to explore what 2-player Hanabi has to offer.  From my experience, 2-player games are interesting and fun, where you are allowed to quickly gain experience and are still able to do special moves compared to 3-player+ games.  Self Color Bluffs, for example, they are illegal in 3 or more player games; however, they are one of the most common moves in 2-player games.
* Believe it or not, 2-player games are key to become a top Hanabi player. First, the gameplay is quite fast.  This allows you to accumulate a lot of experience to deal with troubles in various situations. Secondly, 2-player games are heavily contextual.  These games will help you cultivate your play style to train you to understand clues contextually in order to respond accordingly.
* As a player who has over 4000+ games in 2-player, Iâ€™ve found a lot of players tend to struggle. Thus, this is the main reason I wrote this document, in the hopes that everyone can enjoy 2-player games and be able to get the maximum scores for the variants that they wish to have. Happy hunting!

## General Guide

### First Turn Stall Guide

> #### First Turn Stalls
> * On the very first turn of the game, if a known-unplayable card is clued, then it should be treated as a *Save Clue* (instead of a *Self-Finesse*).
> * Note that players are allowed to use this ability even if there are other playable cards in the hand.

* First, look at your teammate's hand, is it able to give a *Save Clue* to "setup" a *Finesse*, a *Bluff* or even a *5 Pull*?
* Then you should note that if there are any critical cards on chop (or 2s) needed to be saved, and your teammate might discard on their turn? (e.g. you don't have playable cards)
* In this situation, you might have to think that whether you should to take a risk to setup the *Finesse*, or just simply give a *Save Clue* on their *Chop*.
* There is no correct answer, you have to balance the pros and cons depending on the situation yourself.

### Chop Move Guide

* *Chop Moves* are extremely important in 2-player games. Knowing how to perform a *Chop Move* in different circumstances is key to win maximum scores.
* See [here](Chop_Move_Guide.md) for more details.

### Self Color Bluff Guide

> #### Self Color Bluff (SCB)
> * In non-2-player games, *Self-Bluffs* with color clues are explicitly illegal. However, in 2-player games, they are allowed.
> * In other words, if a color clue does not touch a brand-new card and the player who receives the clue knows that the cards touched are not playable, then they know it is a signal to blind-play their *Finessed Position*.
> * Thus, *Tempo Clues* take priority over *Self Color Bluff* by means of *Occam's Razor*.
> * Note that you are also allowed to perform a *Self Color Bluff* by touching a *Chop Moved* card.

* This is one of the most powerful move in 2-player, which not only provides more information on your teammate's clued card, but also get a free blind-card.
* Tip: Always give the clue by touching a one-away card, because it is more likely to be playable compared to two or more away card.
* If you want to play hanabi extremely aggressively, you can perform a *Self Color Bluff* by touching any card which is not on slot 1, including a *Chop Moved* card or any other brand-new card (if it has full context that it is not playable).
* For example, a *Brown & Light Pink (6 Suits)* game:
  * [154213, Turn 21](https://hanabi.live/replay/154213/21): Bluffing a pink 1 by touching a brand-new green 3 with a green clue.
  * [154213, Turn 33](https://hanabi.live/replay/154213/33): Bluffing a yellow 2 by touching a brand-new brown 4 with a brown clue. (*Telling my teammate they have a brown 4 so that we don't need to worry about brown blocking cards for the rest of the game.*)
* Another example, a *Light Pink (6 Suits)* game:
  * [160146, Turn 21](https://hanabi.live/replay/160146/21): Bluffing a purple 1 by touching a brand-new red 5 on chop with a red clue. (***Typically, it is a 5CE!***)
  * [160146, Turn 43](https://hanabi.live/replay/160146/43): Bluffing a green 1 by touching a brand-new (critical) blue 4 with a blue clue. (*Pre-saving a critical card.*)

<br/>

## Variant-Specific Guide

### Hard Suits
* *Brown*, *Muddy Rainbow*, and *Null* are hard suits.
* *[Double Loaded Play Clue](#double-loaded-play-clue)* and *[Overloaded Play Clue](#overloaded-play-clue)* are turned on in the variants with a hard suit.

### Brown

* If you receive *Play Clue* with a brown clue, and if you see your teammate has a brown card through your own hand. It is always better to give a *Play Clue* (or a *Tempo Clue*) focusing that brown card before playing your own card.

### Null

* If a move looks like a *Trash Chop Move* then it is never a *Positional Clue*, unless you have enough contextual read that it is not a *Trash Chop Move*.

* [About Save Clues](#about-save-clues)
* [Miscellaneous](#miscellaneous)
* [Variant-Specific Conventions](#variant-specific-conventions)

<br/>

## About Play Clues

### 4 Single Bluff

* The players are allowed to perform a *4 Single Bluff* by touching a two-away 4 with a rank clue, if the 4 looks like a one-away card, and this move only gets one blind-card.
* The 4 that was used as a *4 Single Bluff* is not promised to be one-away. And the player who receives the clue should mark nothing on their card.

### Double Loaded Play Clue

* This convention only apply to the variants with a hard suit.
* *Loaded action* is a situation where the player has `a playable card` or `a known trash`.
* If a clue is given to a chop card and the player has two or more *loaded actions*, then it is treated as a *Play Clue* on that card.
* Note that *Loaded Play Clue* is turned off in 2-player.

### Overloaded Play Clue

* This convention only apply to the variants with a hard suit.
* If a player is *Occupied* and they gives a clue touching a chop card while the clue receiver has a *loaded action*, then it is treated as a *Play Clue* on that card.
* Note that *Occupied Play Clue* and *Loaded Play Clue* are turned off in 2-player.

### Chop Overflowed Positional Clue

* If the player performs a *Double Chop Move* by discarding or misplaying while their teammate only has one card to *Chop Move*; or a *Triple Chop Move*, and their teammate only has one or two cards.
* In this situation, they are trying to perform a *Chop Move* (to all their cards) and a *Positional Clue* (corresponds to the slot they are discarding or misplaying) at the same time.
* For example:
  * Alice has a playable card. Her *Chop* is on slot 3.
  * Bob has an important card on his *Finessed Chop* (a term used to describe the situation where a player's *Chop* is also on their *Fienssed Position*).
  * If Alice discards slot 3, then it is just a *Scream Discard Chop Move*.
  * If Alice discards slot 2, then it is a *Double Chop Move* (*Scream Discard Chop Move* + *Skipped Discard Chop Move*). However, it doesn't make sense, since Bob only has one card to *Chop Move*. Therefore, it is a *Single Chop Move* on Bob and a *Positional Clue* on his slot 2.
  * Similarly, if Alice misplays slot 3, then it is a *Double Scream Blind-Play*. However, it doesn't make sense, since Bob only has one card to *Chop Move*. Therefore, it is a *Single Chop Move* on Bob and a *Positional Clue* on his slot 3.

<br/>

## About Save Clues

### Crazy 3/4 Fake Saves

* If there are a 3 or 4 in the trash pile, and if the players don't know they have the other copy of that card (even it is in their hand), they are allowed to "fake save" a random 3 or 4 on chop. And the player who receives the clue shouldn't play into the finesse or bluff.
* Do not perform this move on a two-away 3 or 4. (Unless you think it is valuable.)

### Sacrifice Discard Chop Move

* If the player is locked, and their teammate's *Chop* is on their *Finessed Position*, and the teammate draws a critical card. In this situation, the player who is locked can sacrifice one of their card to *Chop Move* their teammate as a *Sacrifice Discard Chop Move*.

### Implied Saves

* If the player receives a *Play Clue* and they don't exactly know the identity of their card, and they see their teammate has a possible "matching" card on their chop (might not be true). Even though there are multiple possibilities for the card, in this situation if they know their teammate won't misplay or play into a *Finesse* or a *Bluff* from context, they can "protect" that card on chop by giving a clue directly.
* For example, in a 4 suits game:
  * Red 1 and blue 1 are played on the stacks.
  * Alice discarded last turn while Bob has a blue 3 on chop.
  * Bob gives a 2 clue touching a red 2 on Alice's slot 1.
  * Alice knows that the 2 could be either a red 2 or blue 2. If it is a blue 2 and Bob might discard the blue 3 if he has nothing to do. Alice gives a blue clue touching the blue 3 on Bob's chop.
  * Bob sees the only playable blue card is blue 2. However, if it is a blue 2, Alice will not disard last turn. He knows that Alice doesn't know the identity of her 2, if she has a blue 2, it is fair enough to protect the blue 3 on chop.
  * Bob marks his blue card as a 3 and discards

<br/>

## Miscellaneous

### Anxiety Play Shift

* This applies to situations where a player becomes locked but has a playable card or has a playable card through a partner's clued cards.
* Generally in an *Anxiety* situation, the player must play the card that is most likely playable.
* However, what if that card isn't playable? A partner must continue to discard to generate clues to prevent an *Anxiety Play*. Thus, each discard can "shift" the *Anxiety Focus* over by 1 slot.
* For example:
  * TODO

### Self Color Ejection

* Generally, if the player delays one turn to give a direct *Play Clue* then it should be interpreted as a *Self Color Bluff*.
* However, what if the player delays **two turns** to give a direct *Play Clue*? In this situation, if the clue giver does not make a mistake, and if the clue receiver didn't draw new cards in two turns, then it is a signal as an *Ejection*. The clue receiver should blind-play their *Second Finessed Position* as a *Self Color Ejection*.

<br/>

## Variant-Specific Conventions

### Pink Crazy Bluff/Pull

* This convention only applies to variants with a pink suit.
* The players are allowed to use any pink card to do a *3 Bluff*, *4 Doulbe Bluff*, or *5 Pull*.
* *Pink Promise* doesn't apply to the card that is used for *Pink Crazy Bluff/Pull*.

### Pink Crazy 5's Chop Move

* This convention only applies to variants with a pink suit.
* For an emergancy, the players are allowed to break the *Pink Promise* to do a *5's Chop Move* by touching a non-5 pink card with a 5 clue.
* You can only do this with a `pink 2` or a `critical pink card`.

### Null Color Positional Clues Changed

* This convention only applies to variants with a null suit.
* A *Color Positional Clue* corresponds to a slot number that is based on the order of the stacks. Stacks correspond to the slot numbers **from left to right**. *("from right to left" in a 3 or more player game)*
* *Color Positional Clues* always "wrap around" to the **newest** card. *("oldest" in a 3 or more player game)*

### Null Positional Double Bluff
* If the player who received a *Positional Clue* cannot find a null card after blind-playing 2 playable cards, they should stop digging for null card as a known *Positional Double Bluff*.
