## General Guide

### First Turn Stall Guide

> #### First Turn Stalls
> * On the very first turn of the game, if a known-unplayable card is clued, then it should be treated as a *Save Clue* (instead of a *Self-Finesse*).
> * Note that players are allowed to use this ability even if there are other playable cards in the hand.

* First, look at your teammate's hand, is it able to give a *Save Clue* to "setup" a *Finesse*, a *Bluff* or even a *5 Pull*?
* Then you should note that if there are any critical cards on chop (or 2s) needed to be saved, and your teammate might discard on their turn? (e.g. you don't have playable cards)
* In this situation, you might have to think that whether you should to take a risk to setup the *Finesse*, or just simply give a *Save Clue* on their *Chop*.
* There is no correct answer, you have to balance the pros and cons depending on the situation yourself.

### Chop Move Guide

* If you have two or more unknown 1s, you can use *[Order Chop Move](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/Reference.md#the-order-chop-move--the-skipped-order-chop-move)*.
  * Skip 1 card: *Single Chop Move*
  * Skip 2 cards: *Double Chop Move*
  * and so on...
* If you are not in emergancy, these are some kinds of *Chop Moves* you might need in the game.
  * If your teammate has a 5 one-away from chop: *[5's Chop Move](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/Reference.md#the-5s-chop-move)*
  * If your teammate has a trash: *[Trash Chop Move](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/Reference.md#the-trash-chop-move)*
    * Note that it should always be interpreted as a *Trash Chop Move* instead of a *Positional Clue* in the variants with a Null suit (or any variant relied on *Positional Clues*).
  * If your teammate has a playable card through your own hand: *[Selfish Chop Move](Selfish_Conventions.md#selfish-chop-move)*
* If you don't want to waste a clue to save a card on chop, especially when your teammate's chop is on slot 1, use the following recommended *Chop Moves* in different situation.
  * If you have a playable card: *[Scream Discard Chop Move](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/Reference.md#the-scream-discard-chop-move-deliberately-discarding-instead-of-playing)*
  * If you don't have a playable card: *[Skipped Discard Chop Move](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/misc/2-Player.md#the-skipped-discard-chop-move)*
    * ***Important Notes***: If your teammate has a critical card on *Chop*, and the card is also on their *Fienssed Position*. In this situation, **do not** lock your teammate by giving (wasting) a direct *Save Clue*, unless there are more than 5 clues in the bank. Simply *Chop Move* your teammate with the *Skipped Discard Chop Move* to generate more clues for your teammate to survive while they are locked.
  * If you have a trash: *[Whisper Discard Chop Move](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/Reference.md#the-whisper-discard-chop-move)*
  * If you have two or more trash: *[Trash Order Chop Move](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/Reference.md#trash-order-chop-move)*
* For an emergancy, if your teammate has two or more cards needed to be saved, use these conventions.
  * Two cards: *[Double Scream Blind-Play (Blind-Playing Chop)](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/misc/2-Player.md#the-double-scream-blind-play-blind-playing-chop)*
  * Three or more cards: *[Misplay Chop Move](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/Reference.md#the-misplay-chop-move)*

### Color Bluff Guide

> #### Self-Bluffs with Color Clues
> * In non-2-player games, *Self-Bluffs* with color clues are explicitly illegal. However, in 2-player games, they are allowed.
> * In other words, if a color clue does not touch a brand-new card and the player who receives the clue knows that the cards touched are not playable, then they know it is a signal to blind-play their *Finessed Position*.
> * Thus, *Tempo Clues* take priority over *Self-Color Bluff* by means of *Occam's Razor*.
> * Note that you are also allowed to perform a *Self-Bluff* by touching a *Chop Moved* card.

* This is one of the most powerful move in 2-player, which not only provides more information on your teammate's clued card, but also get a free blind-card.
* If you want to play hanabi extremely aggressively, you can perform a *Self-Bluff* by touching any card which is not on slot 1, including a *Chop Moved* card or any other brand-new card (if it has full context that it is not playable).
* Game Example (ID: 154213), a *Brown & Light Pink (6 Suits)* game:
  * [Turn 21](https://hanabi.live/replay/154213/21): Bluffing a pink 1 by touching a brand-new green 3 with a green clue.
  * [Turn 33](https://hanabi.live/replay/154213/33): Bluffing a yellow 2 by touching a brand-new brown 4 with a brown clue.

<br/>

## Variant-Specific Guide

### Brown

* If you receive *Play Clue* with a brown clue, and if you see your teammate has a brown card through your own hand. It is always better to give a *Play Clue* (or a *Tempo Clue*) focusing that brown card before playing your own card.

<br/>

## Other Conventions

### 4 Single Bluff

* The players are allowed to perform a *4 Single Bluff* by touching a two-away 4 with a rank clue, if the 4 looks like a one-away card, and this move only gets one blind-card.
* The 4 that was used as a *4 Single Bluff* is not promised to be one-away. And the player who receives the clue should mark nothing on their card.

### Crazy 3/4 Fake Saves

* If there are a 3 or 4 in the trash pile, and if the players don't know they have the other copy of that card (even it is in their hand), they are allowed to "fake save" a random 3 or 4 on chop. And the player who receives the clue shouldn't play into the finesse or bluff.
* Do not perform this move on a two-away 3 or 4. (Unless you think it is valuable.)

### Implied Saves

* If the player receives a *Play Clue* and they don't exactly know the identity of their card, and they see their teammate has a possible "matching" card on their chop (might not be true). Even though there are multiple possibilities for the card, in this situation if they know their teammate won't misplay or play into a *Finesse* or a *Bluff* from context, they can "protect" that card on chop by giving a clue directly.
* For example, in a 4 suits game:
  * Red 1 and blue 1 are played on the stacks.
  * Alice discarded last turn while Bob has a blue 3 on chop.
  * Bob gives a 2 clue touching a red 2 on Alice's slot 1.
  * Alice knows that the 2 could be either a red 2 or blue 2. If it is a blue 2 and Bob might discard the blue 3 if he has nothing to do. Alice gives a blue clue touching the blue 3 on Bob's chop.
  * Bob sees the only playable blue card is blue 2. However, if it is a blue 2, Alice will not disard last turn. He knows that Alice doesn't know the identity of her 2, if she has a blue 2, it is fair enough to protect the blue 3 on chop.
  * Bob marks his blue card as a 3 and discards

### Sacrifice Discard Chop Move

* If the player is locked, and their teammate's *Chop* is on their *Finessed Position*, and the teammate draws a critical card. In this situation, the player who is locked can sacrifice one of their card to *Chop Move* their teammate as a *Sacrifice Discard Chop Move*.

### Anxiety Play Shift

* This applies to situations where a player becomes locked but has a playable card or has a playable card through a partner's clued cards.
* Generally in an *Anxiety* situation, the player must play the card that is most likely playable.
* However, what if that card isn't playable? A partner must continue to discard to generate clues to prevent an *Anxiety Play*. Thus, each discard can "shift" the *Anxiety Focus* over by 1 slot.
* For example:
  * 

<br/>

## Variant-Specific Conventions

### Pink Crazy Bluff/Pull

* This convention only applies to variants with a pink suit.
* The players are allowed to use any pink card to do a *3 Bluff*, *4 Doulbe Bluff*, or *5 Pull*.
* *Pink Promise* doesn't apply to the card that is used for *Pink Crazy Bluff/Pull*.

### Pink Crazy 5's Chop Move

* This convention only applies to variants with a pink suit.
* For an emergancy, the players are allowed to break the *Pink Promise* to do a *5's Chop Move* by touching a non-5 pink card with a 5 clue.
* You can only do this with a `pink 2` or a `critical pink card`.

### Null Color Positional Clues Changed

* This convention only applies to variants with a null suit.
* A *Color Positional Clue* corresponds to a slot number that is based on the order of the stacks. Stacks correspond to the slot numbers **from left to right**. *("from right to left" in a 3 or more player game)*
* *Color Positional Clues* always "wrap around" to the **newest** card. *("oldest" in a 3 or more player game)*

### Null Positional Double Bluff
* If the player who received a *Positional Clue* cannot find a null card after blind-playing 2 playable cards, they should stop digging for null card as a known *Positional Double Bluff*.
