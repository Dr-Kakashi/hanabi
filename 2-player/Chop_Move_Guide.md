* If you have two or more unknown 1s, you can use *[Order Chop Move](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/Reference.md#the-order-chop-move--the-skipped-order-chop-move)*.
  * Skip 1 card: *Single Chop Move*
  * Skip 2 cards: *Double Chop Move*
  * and so on...
* If you are not in emergancy, these are some kinds of *Chop Moves* you might need in the game.
  * If your teammate has a 5 one-away from chop: *[5's Chop Move](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/Reference.md#the-5s-chop-move)*
    * Remember it is just a *5 Stall* if you are in *8 Clues Situation*.
  * If your teammate has a trash: *[Trash Chop Move](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/Reference.md#the-trash-chop-move)*
    * Note that it should always be interpreted as a *Trash Chop Move* instead of a *Positional Clue* in the variants with a Null suit (or any variant relied on *Positional Clues*).
  * If your teammate has a playable card through your own hand: *[Selfish Chop Move](Selfish_Conventions.md#selfish-chop-move)*
  * If your teammate has a card of one-of-each suit and it is one-away from chop: *[Dark Chop Move](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/misc/2-Player.md#the-dark-chop-move)*
* If you don't want to waste a clue to save a card on chop, use the following recommended *Chop Moves* in different situation.
  * ***Important Notes***: If your teammate has a critical card on *Chop*, and the card is also on their *Fienssed Position*. In this situation, **do not** lock your teammate by giving (wasting) a direct *Save Clue*, unless there are more than 5 clues in the bank. Simply "save" it with one of the following *Chop Moves* to generate more clues for your teammate to survive while they are locked.
  * If you have a playable card: *[Scream Discard Chop Move](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/Reference.md#the-scream-discard-chop-move-deliberately-discarding-instead-of-playing)*
  * If you don't have a playable card: *[Skipped Discard Chop Move](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/misc/2-Player.md#the-skipped-discard-chop-move)*
  * If you have a trash: *[Whisper Discard Chop Move](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/Reference.md#the-whisper-discard-chop-move)*
  * If you have two or more trash: *[Trash Order Chop Move](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/Reference.md#trash-order-chop-move)*
* For an emergancy, if your teammate has two or more cards needed to be saved, use these conventions.
  * Two cards: *[Double Scream Blind-Play (Blind-Playing Chop)](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/misc/2-Player.md#the-double-scream-blind-play-blind-playing-chop)*
  * Three or more cards: *[Misplay Chop Move](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/Reference.md#the-misplay-chop-move)*
