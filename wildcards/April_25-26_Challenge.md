## General Conventions (2-player)

### 2 Stalls & 5 Stalls
* In each player's first turn, players are allowed to "stall" with a 2 clue or a 5 clue.

### Color Positional Clues
* Any color clue should be treated as a _Positional Clue_. See the [rules](#color-positional-clues-rules-for-hanabilive) below.

### Color Saves
* Any color clue on chop is treated as a _Save Clue_. (only saving one card)

### Relaxed 2 Saves
* It is optional for players to give _Save Clues_ to 2's.
* Thus, if a 2 is discarded, players should not make any _Elimination Notes_ for them.
