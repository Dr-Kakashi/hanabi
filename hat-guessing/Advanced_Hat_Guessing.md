# Advanced Hat-Guessing Conventions

This is an advanced version of [hat-guessing conventions](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/misc/Hat_Guessing.md) created by [IAMJEFF](https://github.com/iamwhoiamhahaha) in 2020.

<br />

## Introduction

* In regular hat-guessing conventions, players are not able to do a finesse by encoding an action on a one-way card while giving a clue. However, players are now able to do it with these advanced conventions.
* The convention is optimal for any variant with **high required efficiency** and **low starting pace**, e.g., a 3 suits 5-player game.

<br />

## General Conventions

* Most of the rules follow [the conventions](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/misc/Hat_Guessing.md#other-conventions) in regular hat-guessing conventions.

### Priority Rules

* If a player has two or more playable cards (or one-away cards), the priority is as follows:
  1) Unique (e.g. black 1)
  2) Lowest rank
  3) Left-most
* Playable cards and one-away cards have same priority, no one is higher than the other.

### Finesse Rules

* If a one-away card is finessed, then the finessed component doesn't need to follow the _Priority Rules_.
* If two or more players have same copies of the finessed component, the finesse is on the last player who has it.

### Chop Move Rules

* The players are not allowed to chop move a card while that player has a playable card.
* The players are only allowed to chop move critical cards.

### Discard Rules

* Since _Good Touch Principle_ doesnâ€™t apply to these conventions, players should always discard their right-most card, unless it is chop moved.
